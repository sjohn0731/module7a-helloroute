Required Knowledge Check

1) What is Laravel and why is it useful for developers?
    Laravel is a web framework, a pre-made package that has the necessary components - security, the MVC, database interaction, etc. - already coded out, leaving developers more time and resources to dedicate to         building an application, instead of building everything necessary to make an application work from scratch.
2) What does the /greet/{name} route do?
    The /greet/{name} route works like a variable placeholder, ready to display any text entered at the end of the URL. If the application is built out enough and has data associated with the text string entered, it     can potentially display it/interact with it/etc.
3) Why is it important to use Git and GitHub in software projects?
   Version control. It is a way to track the process of an application during the building process. Version control can be used to revert back to a previous version of an application if there is a bug or coding issue too complex to edit in the code. Can also be used to track which software developer made which changes to the application, to help track any issues, developer milestones, etc.
